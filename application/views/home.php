		Hi my name is Chris Janda and I develop robust fully functional webpages.  I am a professional developer with exceptional </br>
		backend development skills.  I have my programming roots in Java and Oracle SQL and from there I have learned PHP, </br>
		Javascript, and JQuery.  I am expanding my knowledge in HTML5 and CSS3 and work incessantly to keep up with burgeoning </br>
		technologies.
	</p>
	<p>
		I have a passion for development because of my love of solving problems and bringing people's ideas to fruition.  It is always an</br>
		amazing adventure to work with clients and see their vision and then make it a reality.

		This site is built using a mySQL database on the backend and the CodeIgniter framework.
